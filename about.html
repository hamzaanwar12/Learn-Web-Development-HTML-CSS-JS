                    centralized authority. It purely works on the basis of global consensus that do not allow any user to change data on the network
                    without consent of all other users.

                    Blockchain is actually a string of blocks that contain data record entered by the users. The data in blockchains is not stored in the 
                    form of tables as in ordinary databases rather it is recorded in the form of some codes with the help of cryptographic encryption algorithms.
                    Once a block is completely filled it is added to the chain that links it to the previous blocks in a chronological method. All users on the 
                    network have the copy of the database that makes this technology transparent and trustworthy.
