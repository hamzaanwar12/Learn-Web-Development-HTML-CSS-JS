                    blockchains
                    is
                    not stored in the
                    form of tables as in ordinary databases rather it is recorded in the form of some codes with the
                    help of
                    cryptographic encryption algorithms.
                    Once a block is
                    <address>
                        completely filled it is added to the chain that links it to the previous blocks in a
                        chronological
                        method. All users on the
                        network have the copy of the database that makes this technology transparent and trustworthy.

                    in the database. This encrypting of data and blocks brings up the concept of hash values.
